# Xamarin.Android-accessibility
Presentation I gave to improve the accessibility on our Xamarin Android application

## What the files contain
The PDF is the same as the PowerPoint, just for people who dont have the MS Office Suite

The PowerPoint contains how to:

* Enable Talkback Accessibility,
* Test Accessibility
* Develop and Fix accessibility using the different properties, functions and delegates

### Ways to contribute
Just fork, create changes in your branch, and then create a Pull Request.

You could also just create issues and I will take a look at them
