## Xamarin Forms implementation of Accessibility

Currently, from the testing in this example, the Automation Properties objects aren't accessibile through XAML as they should be, according to https://blog.xamarin.com/accessbility-xamarin-forms/ but there is a way to use C# to implement instead 

### Ways to contribute
Just fork, create changes in your branch, and then create a Pull Request.

You could also just create issues and I will take a look at them
