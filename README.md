# Xamarin Accessibility - Android, iOS Native and Forms

## Xamarin.Android-accessibility
The Presentation attached is one I gave to improve the accessibility on our Xamarin Android application

## What the files contain
The PDF is the same as the PowerPoint, just for people who dont have the MS Office Suite

The PowerPoint contains how to:

* Enable Talkback Accessibility,
* Test Accessibility
* Develop and Fix accessibility using the different properties, functions and delegates

You could also [go here](https://tinyurl.com/y2wyho8h) to check out the updated Presentation that I gave in September 2019 at MonkeyFestLatam, containing accessibility for about iOS & Xamarin Forms as well.

### Ways to contribute
Just fork, create changes in your branch, and then create a Pull Request.

You could also just create issues and I will take a look at them. I need to add an example for accessibility in a Xamarin Native Android app.
